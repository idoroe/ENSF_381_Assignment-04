i made a python virtual environment in the root directory of the repo(ENSF_381_ASSIGNMENT-04) named it venv and added it to gitignore
 so our venv doesnt push to our repo when we make commits. You can also make yours too 
 so you can install flask and maybe other dependencies there to aid collaboration
